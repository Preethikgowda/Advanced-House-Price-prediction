# 🏠 Advanced House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the final sale prices of residential homes using advanced regression techniques on a dataset containing detailed information about houses. The dataset used is from the Kaggle competition: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
